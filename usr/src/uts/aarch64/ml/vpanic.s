/*
 * The panic() and cmn_err() functions invoke vpanic() as a common entry point
 * into the panic code implemented in panicsys().  vpanic() is responsible
 * for passing through the format string and arguments, and constructing a
 * regs structure on the stack into which it saves the current register
 * values.  If we are not dying due to a fatal trap, these registers will
 * then be preserved in panicbuf as the current processor state.  Before
 * invoking panicsys(), vpanic() activates the first panic trigger (see
 * common/os/panic.c) and switches to the panic_stack if successful.  Note that
 * DTrace takes a slightly different panic path if it must panic from probe
 * context.  Instead of calling panic, it calls into dtrace_vpanic(), which
 * sets up the initial stack as vpanic does, calls dtrace_panic_trigger(), and
 * branches back into vpanic().
